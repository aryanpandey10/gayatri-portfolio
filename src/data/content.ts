  shortBio: `Toronto-based painter and Registered Early Childhood Educator (RECE) with a heart full of mountains, mithai, and sparkles. I create warm, soulful art while nurturing little humans — because both children and canvases deserve love, patience, and a little bit of magic.`,

  fullBio: `Namaste, I’m Gayatri — a December-born Punjabi girl who found her sukoon between the mountains of Toronto and the smell of ghee roasting in the kitchen.

By day, I’m a devoted Montessori & preschool educator who has spent over 5 years helping tiny humans grow with love, respect, and creativity — most recently as a Supervisor at Alive Montessori & Private School in Forest Hill, Toronto. I believe children learn the way they live: through warmth, listening, and freedom to explore. That same philosophy flows into my art.

By night (and early mornings, and weekends), I paint. My canvases are filled with emotions I can’t always say out loud — soft portraits, dreamy abstracts, warm tones that feel like home. I paint the way I teach: gently, intentionally, and always with sparkle.

I talk to myself (sometimes I even scold myself — "Gayatri, yeh kya kar rahi hai tu?"), I cry at beautiful songs, I dream of Greece and Venice, and I truly believe that the smell of mithai cooking in ghee is the definition of home.

I’m Geet energy in real life — a little childish, quietly strong, perfume-obsessed, mountain-loving, and forever Papa’s girl.

Thank you for being here. Whether you're here for the art, the heart, or just to feel a little warmer today — I’m glad our paths crossed.`,
